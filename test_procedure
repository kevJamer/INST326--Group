If you would like to test the appliactions abillity to send notifications without wating a entire day you should follow theses steps 
1. Go to the notificationcenter.py file 
2. Next in the class NotifcationCenter find the definition press_button
3. in this method you will find another definition called email(text)
4. if you go all the way to the bottom of the method you will see a line of code "schedule.every().day.do(email,text=f'{text}')"
5. to test the codes functionality quicker you will need to change ().day parameter to something sonner 
6. you can change it to ().mintue or ().second or more spcifically (20).seconds this will make the code repeat every 20 seconds 
7. now run the script gui.py from the command line
8. when both windows pop open click on the Notfication Center and enter your email
9. After 20 seconds you will get an email with all the advice in it.
10. this is how you test the code but remember to close out of the gui after you tested it or it will spam your email.
